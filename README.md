#Description

Doc-nft-minter is a unique Dapp where the owner can use the Dapp to mint documents into a form of NFT to show other parties as evidence of ownership of properties. It also has a transfer function that can facilitate the transfer of the NFT Document to another address. But only the owner of the contract can see the transfer button or to mint button.
